## My Widgets - ServiceNow

This repository contains the files for the My Widgets application on ServiceNow's Now Platform.

A Portal has been created to house a menu with links to the widgets that are created for future use in other applications.

This application was created for the purpose, also, of organizing the widgets that I develop, in order to always backup them on GitHub.
